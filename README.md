Hello, my name is Piyadet Kitphadung (thiw).

As a dedicated data analyst with over 1 year and 7 months of UX/UI design experience, I bring a unique blend of creative and analytical skills to my work. My background in design enriches my data analysis capabilities, allowing me to understand user needs deeply and develop user-friendly solutions. At Business Services Alliance Co., Ltd., I managed well-being initiatives for PTT Public Company Limited and its affiliates, strengthening my ability to apply data-driven insights to real-world scenarios. I am passionate about continuous professional development and eager to transition fully into a data analyst role, where I can leverage my skills to provide valuable insights and drive informed decision-making for improved user experiences.
