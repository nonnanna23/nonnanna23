<H1>Hello, my name is Piyadet Kitphadung (thiw).</H1>

With over two years of diverse experience in both UX/UI design and HRIS engineering, I have cultivated a unique skill set that bridges creativity with technical expertise. My career began at Be1 Digital Co., Ltd., where I played a pivotal role in designing user-centric platforms for health, internal communication, and surveys. My responsibilities spanned product structure design, visual design, and even leading as a scrum master, which honed my leadership and project management skills.

Eager to broaden my horizons, I transitioned into an HRIS engineering role at Business Services Alliance Co., Ltd., where I took on the challenge of managing HR-related processes for the PTT Group. This move underscored my commitment to continuous learning and adaptability, enabling me to contribute effectively in dynamic and evolving environments.

I'm passionate about leveraging my diverse experience to drive innovation and success in future endeavors.
